    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter,
      Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish.
      Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor.
      Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.
      It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.
